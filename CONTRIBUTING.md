# Contributing to Echo

Welcome, chrononaut! Echo thrives when timelines collaborate. Please read this guide before diving in.

## Project Philosophy
Echo is a deterministic, renderer-agnostic engine. We prioritize:
- **Determinism**: every change must preserve reproducible simulations.
- **Documentation**: specs and decision logs live alongside code.
- **Temporal Tooling**: features support branching timelines and merges.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo and run `cargo check` to ensure the Rust workspace builds.
2. Read `docs/architecture-outline.md` and `docs/execution-plan.md`.
3. Review `AGENTS.md` for collaboration norms before touching runtime code.
4. Optional: develop inside the devcontainer for toolchain parity with CI.
   - Open in VS Code ‚Üí "Reopen in Container" (requires the Dev Containers extension).
- The container includes Rust 1.71.1 (via rust-toolchain.toml), clippy/rustfmt, Node, and gh.
- Post-create installs toolchain 1.71.1 (no override); wasm32 target and components are added to 1.71.1.

## Branching & Workflow
- Keep `main` pristine. Create feature branches like `echo/<feature>` or `timeline/<experiment>`.
- Before starting work, ensure `git status` is clean. If not, resolve or coordinate with the human operator.
- Before each session, update the ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Intent‚Äù section in `docs/execution-plan.md` so future collaborators can follow the timeline.

## Testing Expectations
- Write tests before or alongside code changes.
- `cargo test` must pass locally before PR submission.
- Add unit/integration coverage for new logic; Lua/TypeScript tooling will regain coverage when reintroduced.

## Documentation & Telemetry
- Update relevant docs in `docs/` whenever behavior or architecture changes.
- Record major decisions or deviations in the execution plan or decision log tables.
- Capture breadcrumbs for future Codex agents in `docs/decision-log.md` or related specs.

## Submitting Changes
1. Run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test`.
2. Commit with meaningful messages (no conventional prefixes; tell the story).
3. Push your branch and open a PR. Include:
   - Summary of changes and motivation.
   - Tests performed.
   - Any timeline or determinism considerations.
4. Request review from maintainers (see CODEOWNERS).

## Code Style
- Rust code must pass `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` without warnings.
- Lua scripts should remain deterministic (no uncontrolled globals, RNG via engine services).
- TypeScript tooling (when active) lives in `reference/typescript/`; follow local lint configs when reactivated.
- Avoid non-deterministic APIs (no wall-clock, no uncontrolled randomness). Use Echo‚Äôs deterministic services.

### Git Hooks (recommended)
- Install repo hooks once: `make hooks` (configures `core.hooksPath` to `.githooks`).
- Pre-commit runs:
  - cargo fmt (auto-fix by default; set `ECHO_AUTO_FMT=0` for check-only)
  - Toolchain pin verification (matches `rust-toolchain.toml`)
  - A minimal docs-guard: when core API files change, it requires updating `docs/execution-plan.md` and `docs/decision-log.md` (mirrors CI)
- To auto-fix formatting on commit: `ECHO_AUTO_FMT=1 git commit -m "message"`

#### Partial Staging & rustfmt
- rustfmt formats entire files, not only staged hunks. To preserve index integrity, our pre-commit hook now aborts the commit if running `cargo fmt` would change any files. It first checks with `cargo fmt --check`, and if changes are needed it applies them and exits with a helpful message.
- Workflow when this happens:
  1) Review formatting changes: `git status` and `git diff`.
  2) Restage intentionally formatted files (e.g., `git add -A` or `git add -p`).
  3) Commit again.
- Tips:
  - If you need to keep a partial-staged commit, do two commits: first commit the formatter-only changes, then commit your code changes.
  - You can switch to check-only with `ECHO_AUTO_FMT=0` (commit will still fail on formatting issues, but nothing is auto-applied).
- Do not bypass hooks. The repo runs fmt, clippy, tests, and rustdoc on the pinned toolchain before push.
- Toolchain: pinned to Rust 1.90.0. Ensure your local override matches:

  - rustup toolchain install 1.90.0
  - rustup override set 1.90.0
- When any Rust code changes (.rs anywhere), update both `docs/execution-plan.md` and `docs/decision-log.md` with intent and a brief rationale. The hook enforces this.

## Communication
- Major updates should land in `docs/execution-plan.md` and `docs/decision-log.md`; rely on GitHub discussions or issues for longer-form proposals.
- Respect the temporal theme‚Äîleave the codebase cleaner for the next timeline traveler.
