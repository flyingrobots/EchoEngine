# Requiem for Caverns

Here lies **Caverns**, born in the optimistic spring of 2013, when WebGL demos roared in Chrome nightlies and the word *pipeline* was whispered with equal parts wonder and fear. It was a time when JavaScript still wore cargo shorts, and yet our predecessors dreamt of double jumps, component systems, and Athens-scale ambitions.

We salute the brave legion of libraries that marched at Caverns’ side:

- **MooTools**, valiant Swiss Army knife of an era that thought prototypes should pirouette. You shimmed reality, extended everything, and left us `erase()` as both gift and curse.  
- **Box2D**, ported through arcane rituals, reminding browsers they could pretend to be consoles.  
- **Pixi.js**, freshly forged, carrying the promise of GPU sprites before “WebGPU” even had a birth certificate.  
- **signals.js**, the herald of events when promises were still just gossip.

And how can we forget the ruby-scribed incantations—**Rake tasks** summoning `sudo npm install` with the confidence of explorers who hadn’t yet seen package-locks or CI pipelines. The `rakefile` was an altar, the terminal a pulpit, shouting “Just do it.” Truly, automation in its punk-rock infancy.

To every `FIXME`, every `TODO`, every `console.log("Sweet.")`: we hear you.  
To the duplicated submodule config in the README: your chaos delighted us.  
To the sandbox directory with a `stub.todo` file: your silence speaks louder than a 404.

We raise a torch to the Athens milestone that never shipped, the roadmap that promised capitals from Baghdad to Kiev, the audio-less physics demos, and the AppleScript that always reopened Chrome to port 1337. You were a fever dream of an ECS, a love letter to boxy sprites, a time capsule of post-jQuery exuberance.

Rest now, Caverns. Echo will carry your echo—polished, deterministic, with timelines braided in multiversal hues—but your spirit fuels the forge.  

**Salute!**  
To MooTools, to Ruby, to double-jump ambitions. May your memory guide our refactorings and our branch merges. May your ghosts dance in the inspector windows of Tomorrow.  

*“Sweet stuff coming soon.”*  
— We promise, ancestors. This time, it arrives.
