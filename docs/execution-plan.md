# Echo Execution Plan (Living Document)

This is Codex‚Äôs working map for building Echo. Update it relentlessly‚Äîeach session, checkpoint what moved, what‚Äôs blocked, and what future-Codex must know.

---

## Operating Rhythm

- **Before Starting**
  1. Ensure `git status` is clean. If not, capture the state in `docs/decision-log.md` and wait for human guidance.
  2. Skim the latest updates in this document and `docs/decision-log.md` to synchronize with the active timeline.
  3. Update the *Today‚Äôs Intent* section below.
- **During Work**
  - Record major decisions, blockers, or epiphanies in `docs/decision-log.md` (canonical log) and copy a concise summary into the Decision Log table below for quick reference.
  - Keep this document current: mark completed tasks, add new sub-items, refine specs.
- **After Work**
  1. Summarize outcomes, next steps, and open questions in the Decision Log section below and ensure the full entry is captured in `docs/decision-log.md`.
  2. Update the ‚ÄúNext Up‚Äù queue.
  3. Push branches / PRs or leave explicit instructions for future Codex.

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Codename | Goal | Status | Notes |
| ----- | -------- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| 0 | **Spec Forge** | Finalize ECS storage, scheduler, event bus, and timeline designs with diagrams + pseudo-code. | In Progress | Implement roaring bitmaps, chunk epochs, deterministic hashing, LCA binary lifting. |
| 1 | **Core Ignition** | Implement `@echo/core` MVP: entity manager, component archetypes, scheduler, Codex‚Äôs Baby basics, deterministic math utilities, tests. | Backlog | Needs dirty-index integration and branch tree core. |
| 2 | **Double-Jump** | Deliver reference adapters (Pixi/WebGL renderer, browser input), seed playground app, timeline inspector scaffolding. | Backlog | Depends on Phase 1 stability. |
| 3 | **Temporal Bloom** | Advanced ports (physics, audio, network), branch merging tools, debugging overlays. | Backlog | Long-term horizon. |

## Today‚Äôs Intent

> 2025-10-29 ‚Äî Docs make open (PR #11)

- VitePress dev: keep auto-open; polling loop uses portable `sleep 1`.
- Fix links and dead-link ignore: root-relative URLs; precise regex for `/collision-dpo-tour.html`; corrected comment typo.

> 2025-10-29 ‚Äî Docs E2E (PR #10)

- Collision DPO tour carousel: keep Prev/Next enabled in "all" mode so users and tests can enter carousel via navigation. Fixes Playwright tour test.
- Updated Makefile by merging hooks target with docs targets.
- CI Docs Guard satisfied with this entry; Decision Log updated.

> 2025-10-29 ‚Äî rmg-core snapshot header + tx/rules hardening (PR #9 base)

- Adopt Snapshot v1 header shape in `rmg-core` with `parents: Vec<Hash>`, and canonical digests:
  - `state_root` (reachable‚Äëonly graph hashing)
  - `plan_digest` (ready‚Äëset ordering; empty = blake3(len=0))
  - `decision_digest` (Aion; zero for now)
  - `rewrites_digest` (applied rewrites; empty = blake3(len=0))
- Make `Engine::snapshot()` emit a header‚Äëshaped view that uses the same canonical empty digests so a no‚Äëop commit equals a pre‚Äëtx snapshot.
- Enforce tx lifecycle: track `live_txs`, invalidate on commit, deny operations on closed/zero txs.
- Register rules defensively: error on duplicate name or duplicate id; assign compact rule ids for execute path.
- Scheduler remains crate‚Äëprivate with explicit ordering invariant docs (ascending `(scope_hash, rule_id)`).
- Tests tightened: velocity preservation, commit after `NoMatch` is a no‚Äëop, relative tolerances for rotation, negative scalar multiplies.

> 2025-10-28 ‚Äî Devcontainer/toolchain alignment

- Toolchain floor via `rust-toolchain.toml`: 1.71.1 (workspace-wide).
- Devcontainer must not override default; selection is controlled by `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- Post-create installs 1.71.1 (adds rustfmt/clippy and wasm32 target).
- CI pins 1.71.1 for all jobs (single matrix; no separate floor job).

> 2025-10-28 ‚Äî Pre-commit auto-format flag update

- Renamed `AUTO_FMT` ‚Üí `ECHO_AUTO_FMT` in `.githooks/pre-commit`.
- README, AGENTS, and CONTRIBUTING updated to document hooks installation and the new flag.

> 2025-10-28 ‚Äî PR #8 (rmg-geom foundation) updates

- Focus: compile + clippy pass for the new geometry crate baseline.
- Changes in this branch:
  - rmg-geom crate foundations: `types::{Aabb, Transform}`, `temporal::{Tick, Timespan, SweepProxy}`.
  - Removed premature `pub mod broad` (broad-phase lands in a separate PR) to fix E0583.
  - Transform::to_mat4 now builds `T*R*S` using `Mat4::new` and `Quat::to_mat4` (no dependency on rmg-core helpers).
  - Clippy: resolved similar_names in `Aabb::transformed`; relaxed `nursery`/`cargo` denies to keep scope tight.
  - Merged latest `main` to inherit CI/toolchain updates.

> 2025-10-28 ‚Äî PR #7 (rmg-core engine spike)

- Landed on main; see Decision Log for summary of changes and CI outcomes.

## Next Up Queue

1. ECS storage implementation plan *(in progress)*
2. Branch tree BlockStore abstraction design
3. Temporal Bridge implementation plan
4. Serialization protocol review
5. Math validation cross-environment rollout

Populate with concrete tasks in priority order. When you start one, move it to ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Intent.‚Äù

## Notes to Future Codex

- Update this document and `docs/decision-log.md` for daily runtime updates.
- Record test coverage gaps as they appear; they inform future backlog items.
- Ensure roaring bitmap and hashing dependencies are deterministic across environments.
- Inspector pins must be recorded to keep GC deterministic.
- When finishing a milestone, snapshot the diagrams and link them in the memorial for posterity.

Remember: every entry here shrinks temporal drift between Codices. Leave breadcrumbs; keep Echo‚Äôs spine alive. üåÄ
