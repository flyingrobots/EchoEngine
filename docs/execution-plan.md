# Echo Execution Plan (Living Document)

This is Codex‚Äôs working map for building Echo. Update it relentlessly‚Äîeach session, checkpoint what moved, what‚Äôs blocked, and what future-Codex must know.

---

## Operating Rhythm

- **Before Starting**
  1. Ensure `git status` is clean. If not, capture the state in `docs/decision-log.md` and wait for human guidance.
  2. Skim the latest updates in this document and `docs/decision-log.md` to synchronize with the active timeline.
  3. Update the *Today‚Äôs Intent* section below.
- **During Work**
  - Record major decisions, blockers, or epiphanies in `docs/decision-log.md` (canonical log) and copy a concise summary into the Decision Log table below for quick reference.
  - Keep this document current: mark completed tasks, add new sub-items, refine specs.
- **After Work**
  1. Summarize outcomes, next steps, and open questions in the Decision Log section below and ensure the full entry is captured in `docs/decision-log.md`.
  2. Update the ‚ÄúNext Up‚Äù queue.
  3. Push branches / PRs or leave explicit instructions for future Codex.

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Codename | Goal | Status | Notes |
| ----- | -------- | ---- | ------ | ----- |
| 0 | **Spec Forge** | Finalize ECS storage, scheduler, event bus, and timeline designs with diagrams + pseudo-code. | In Progress | Implement roaring bitmaps, chunk epochs, deterministic hashing, LCA binary lifting. |
| 1 | **Core Ignition** | Implement `@echo/core` MVP: entity manager, component archetypes, scheduler, Codex‚Äôs Baby basics, deterministic math utilities, tests. | Backlog | Needs dirty-index integration and branch tree core. |
| 2 | **Double-Jump** | Deliver reference adapters (Pixi/WebGL renderer, browser input), seed playground app, timeline inspector scaffolding. | Backlog | Depends on Phase 1 stability. |
| 3 | **Temporal Bloom** | Advanced ports (physics, audio, network), branch merging tools, debugging overlays. | Backlog | Long-term horizon. |

## Today‚Äôs Intent

> 2025-10-27 ‚Äî Geometry & Docs wiring

- Focus: Scaffold `rmg-geom` with AABB/Transform + temporal utilities and a minimal broad-phase; add unit tests (fat AABB, deterministic pair order).
- Secondary: Wire a VitePress docs site and add a page that links to the Collision DPO Tour HTML; add Playwright smoke tests for the tour (load, tabs toggle, prev/next nav).
- Definition of done: New crate builds with docs; tests cover new code paths; docs site skeleton exists; smoke tests added (not yet wired in CI). Update decision log.

## Immediate Backlog

- [x] ECS storage blueprint (archetype layout, chunk metadata, copy-on-write strategy).
- [x] Scheduler pseudo-code and DAG resolution rules.
- [x] Codex‚Äôs Baby command lifecycle with flush phases + backpressure policies.
- [x] Branch tree persistence spec (three-way diffs, roaring bitmaps, epochs, hashing).
- [x] Deterministic math module API surface (vectors, matrices, PRNG, fixed-point toggles).
- [x] Deterministic math validation strategy.
- [x] Branch merge conflict playbook.
- [ ] Scaffold Rust workspace (`crates/rmg-core`, `crates/rmg-ffi`, `crates/rmg-wasm`, `crates/rmg-cli`).
- [ ] Port ECS archetype storage + branch diff engine to Rust.
- [ ] Implement deterministic PRNG + math module in Rust.
- [ ] Expose C ABI for Lua and C integrations.
- [ ] Integrate Lua 5.4 runtime via bindings (mlua or custom FFI).
- [ ] Adapt TypeScript CLI/inspector to Rust backend (WASM/FFI).
- [ ] Archive TypeScript prototype under `/reference/` as spec baseline.
- [ ] Add Rust CI jobs (cargo test, replay verification).

### Code Tasks (Phase 1 prep)
- [x] Install & configure Vitest.
- [ ] Add `rmg-core` test helpers & fixtures modules.
- [ ] Write failing tests for entity ID allocation + recycling in Rust.
- [ ] Prototype `TimelineFingerprint` hashing & equality tests.
- [ ] Scaffold deterministic PRNG wrapper with tests.
- [x] Establish `cargo test`/nextest pipeline in CI (GitHub Actions).
- [ ] Integrate roaring bitmaps into ECS dirty tracking.
- [ ] Implement chunk epoch counters on mutation.
- [ ] Add deterministic hashing module (canonical encode + BLAKE3).
- [ ] Build DirtyChunkIndex pipeline from ECS to branch tree.
- [ ] Implement merge decision recording + decisions digest.
- [ ] Implement paradox detection (read/write set comparison).
- [ ] Implement entropy tracking formula in branch tree.
- [ ] Prototype epoch-aware refcount API (stub for single-thread).
- [ ] Implement deterministic GC scheduler (sorted node order + intervals).
- [ ] Update Codex's Baby to Phase 0.5 spec (event envelope, bridge, backpressure, inspector packet, security).

### Tooling & Docs
- [ ] Build `docs/data-structures.md` with Mermaid diagrams (storage, branch tree with roaring bitmaps).
- [ ] Extend `docs/diagrams.md` with scheduler flow & command queue animations.
- [ ] Publish decision-log quick reference (templates, cadence, examples; owner: Documentation squad before Phase 1 kickoff).
- [ ] Design test fixture layout under `crates/rmg-core/tests/fixtures` with sample component schemas.
- [ ] Document roaring bitmap integration and merge strategies.
- [ ] Update future inspector roadmap with conflict heatmaps and causality lens.

## Next Up Queue

1. Scaffold `rmg-geom` crate + Temporal types
2. Implement Dynamic AABB Tree (broad phase v1)
3. Narrow v1 (spheres/capsules/OBB + manifold)
4. CCD v1 (CA + swept primitives)
5. Mesh BVH and dynamic‚Äìstatic queries

Populate with concrete tasks in priority order. When you start one, move it to ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Intent.‚Äù

## Notes to Future Codex

- Update this document and `docs/decision-log.md` for daily runtime updates.
- Record test coverage gaps as they appear; they inform future backlog items.
- Ensure roaring bitmap and hashing dependencies are deterministic across environments.
- Inspector pins must be recorded to keep GC deterministic.
- When finishing a milestone, snapshot the diagrams and link them in the memorial for posterity.

Remember: every entry here shrinks temporal drift between Codices. Leave breadcrumbs; keep Echo‚Äôs spine alive. üåÄ
