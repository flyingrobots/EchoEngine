# Session Quiz

> AGENT-TO-HUMAN DEBRIEF: HIGH-SIGNAL REPORT

## 0: QUICK HITS

> One word to describe this session:

Consolidation

> Confidence level (1-10) in the final output:

9

> If I had to redo this, I'd spend MORE time on:

Expanding reserve-gate property tests across randomized permutations and edge-only patterns.

> If I had to redo this, I'd spend LESS time on:

Toolchain pinning bikeshedding; it’s necessary, but easy to batch with CI changes later.

## 1: EXECUTION DELTA

> 1.1: Most inefficient part of my internal reasoning process?

Balancing whether to wire telemetry summary under cfg vs always-on finalize; I initially over-scoped with a cfg-only finalize and then corrected to unconditional cleanup.

> 1.2: What did I waste time on that ultimately didn't matter?

Trying to quiet an innocuous `dead_code` warning (kept `rule_by_id` for clarity). No payoff now.

> 1.3: Key Trade-offs

- Prioritized determinism and correctness over micro-optimizations (kept BTree-based sets for independence).
- Used CompactRuleId only on hot execute path; preserved family-id in ordering keys for stability and wire.
- Deferred MIS/batching planner to keep surface area small and tests green.

## 2: HIDDEN STATE & FRAGILITY REPORT

> 2.1: Pruned Ideas

Adding criterion micro-bench in the same pass. Helpful but not critical to correctness and would slow iteration.

> 2.1 Prompt:

“Add a Criterion bench that measures independence checks for 10/100/1000 rewrites and report p95 latency; ensure no allocations on steady state.”

> 2.2: Weakest Link

- Reserve gate coverage: needs more tests for port in/out mixing and masks-disjoint fast-path behavior.
- Build.rs rule-id generation: currently single constant; generalization + runtime assert test is pending.

> 2.2 Prompt:

“Write tests in `reserve_gate_tests.rs` covering b_in vs b_out conflicts and masks-disjoint independence; add a runtime test that recomputes MOTION_RULE_ID and asserts equality.”

> 2.3: Latent Misuse

Consumers might serialize CompactRuleId externally. That would couple binaries and break replay.

> 2.3 Prompt:

“Search crate for external exposure of CompactRuleId and add a compile-time lint/test preventing serialization of CompactRuleId.”

> 2.4: Assumptions About You

Assumed you prefer small, verifiable steps over broad refactors in one commit. If you wanted end-to-end MIS batching today, my pacing would be too conservative.

> 2.4 Prompt:

“Do you want MIS batch planning wired now even if it lands with fewer tests, or keep shipping in thin slices with full coverage?”

> 2.5: The Question You Didn't Ask

How to redact payloads safely for telemetry without losing replay fidelity. This affects privacy and performance.

> 2.5 Prompt:

“Define a redaction policy: which payload types can be elided/hashed in telemetry while still enabling deterministic replay.”

## 3: CONTRARIAN & REFACTORING

> 3.1: The Rival Hypothesis

Compact ids are premature; BLAKE3 family ids are fast enough and simpler. If true, my added mapping adds complexity for negligible wins.

> 3.2: Token Budget Forcing Function

I’d cut the design doc prose and focus solely on code + tests. Reveals that correctness and wiring mattered most.

> 3.3: Peer Review Attack Vector

“Where’s the MIS planner?” and “Why not prove confluence for mixed edge/node patterns?” Fair critique—those are next.

> 3.4: Most Speculative Claim

Claiming telemetry counters are sufficient for planning retries; we still need real-world conflict rate data.

## 4: SYNERGY & UNFILTERED ADVICE

> 4.1: Best of

Tight commits with tests green; minimal API blast radius. This keeps merge friction low.

> 4.2: Worst part

Toolchain pin slowed a local check; better to stage CI pinning separately to avoid rustup churn mid-iteration.

> 4.3: Highlights

- Finalized reserve path and executor mapping.
- Added clear telemetry replay design to avoid re-converging on ordering semantics.

> 4.4: James's Pattern

You push ambitious ideas quickly; the repo benefits, but the surface area can balloon. Splitting into “ship now” vs “prove later” tracks helps.

> 4.5: The Uncomfortable Truth

When many ideas land at once, documentation can lag and future you pays the cost. We mitigated by updating roadmap + decision log immediately.

> 4.6: 10× Synergy

Agree the MIS planner shape up-front (inputs/outputs, invariant) so I can implement in one pass without back-and-forth.

> 4.7: James–Keep Doing This

Demand explicit invariants and tests alongside code.

> 4.8: James–Stop Doing This

Avoid mixing demo polish with core engine changes in the same PR; it muddies review.

> 4.9: James–We Should Talk About This Sometime

Payload redaction defaults and privacy posture for telemetry/replay.

## 5: CLOSING & SYNTHESIS

> 5.1: One piece of advice

Lock the MIS planner API next—planner shape drives scheduler complexity and telemetry needs.

> 5.2: Prompt for the next session

“Implement MIS batch planning over `pending` using footprints; execute batches in stable order (scope_hash, family_id); add tests for N=3..6 commuting groups and measure speedup.”

> 5.3: Hand-off Prompt

“Context: PR #7 branch has reserve gate wired; executor uses CompactRuleId; finalize_tx clears frontier and emits telemetry summary; toolchain pinned to 1.68. Goal: add MIS planner producing maximal independent sets per tick; extend property tests (N=3..6) including edge-only patterns; add criterion bench for independence (10/100/1000). Keep ordering key = (scope_hash, family_id). Deliver small commits with tests green.”

> 5.4: One-Line Summary

Reserve gate finalized, compact-id execution wired, telemetry summarized; docs updated.

> 5.5: Critical thought and improvement

My most critical unshared thought is that MIS will surface any hidden non-determinism quickly; the highest-leverage improvement for James is to prioritize planner invariants and test scaffolding before touching performance.
