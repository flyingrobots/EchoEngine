# Echo Playground

This directory will host the interactive sandbox built with Vite. For now it is a stub so
the workspace layout is in place. Once the core runtime stabilises we will scaffold the
playground with:

- Hot-reload loop wired into `EchoEngine`.
- Timeline viewer overlay powered by the diagram spec.
- Adapter demos (Pixi/WebGPU/TUI).

Stay tuned. The multiverse is under construction.
