# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
${PROJECT_NAME} is under active development on the `${DEFAULT_BRANCH}` branch. Until the first

## Scope
${PROJECT_NAME} is a deterministic engine; common vectors include:
- Sandbox escapes via adapters.
- Abuse of timeline branching APIs.
- Denial-of-service through unbounded queue inputs.

If a vulnerability affects third-party dependencies, we will coordinate with upstream maintainers.
